  Retrieving Data With React
question: >-
  Describe the process of retrieving data with a network request and rendering said data using React.
correct_answers:
  - >-
    The `componentDidMount` component lifecycle method is used when making network requests. Inside `componentDidMount` the network request is described. The `then` method can be chained to the request to manage promises and make sure the network request is completed. The `catch` method can be chained to the `then` method to listen for error messages from the network and utilize them for functionality in the program, or simply for reference. Data is stored in the components `state`, using `setState()` inside of the promise handler. `state` can be passed down as `props` to children components or rendered directly within the component itself.

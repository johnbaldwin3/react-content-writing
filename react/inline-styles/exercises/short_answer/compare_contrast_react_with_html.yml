correct_answers:
  - >-
    Writing inline styles in React is very similar to writing inline styles in a standard HTML document. Styles are declared by providing comma separated property/value pairs to a `style` attribute on the element. React and JSX differ from HTML in that the property/value pairs being passed to the `style` attribute on an element have to be an object and not string. That object is then placed inside an additional pair of curly braces `{}` so that it may be interpolated when the template is rendered. Also, with React and JSX, hyphen separated property names must be camel case.

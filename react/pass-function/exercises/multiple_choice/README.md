## What's this folder for?
This folder is for Newline multiple choice exercises. Cool!

## How do I add multiple choice exercises?
Make sure you use `newline new exercise` and then choose `multiple choice` when prompted to create the a new yaml config file. Once you've done that, open the config and follow the instructions! Repeat as necessary for new questions.

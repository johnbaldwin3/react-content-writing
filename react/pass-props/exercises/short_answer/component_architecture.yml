correct_answers:
  - >-
    Each component should be responsible for a minimal number of elements and minimal functionality. Data management and distribution throughout a project should be handled by multiple components. We should have a lot of "presentational" components that inherit their properties from "container" components. Each should be compartmentalized so that the code can be accessed and reused in the project multiple times if need be. A container component should use its `state` to retain and distribute data to other presentational components. The presentational components render the data via `props`.

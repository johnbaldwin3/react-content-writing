  React State Change
question: >-
  How does react handle state change differently from most other JavaScript view libraries?
correct_answers:
  - >-
    When state changes in React only the necessary components are re-rendered to reflect the state change. Other libraries and frameworks will re-render the entire application. React uses a virtual DOM to track the state of the DOM in memory and compares the new state with the virtual DOM before updating the physical DOM.

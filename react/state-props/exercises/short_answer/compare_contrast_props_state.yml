  Compare Contrast Props State
question: >-
  Compare and contrast props and state in React.
correct_answers: 
  - >-
    Both belong to a React component. Both are plain JavaScript Objects. Both trigger a render update when changed. Props act as the configuration of a component. They are immutable to the component receiving them from a parent component. State is like a snapshot of a component at a specific time. State has a default value when a component mounts and then when a user event occurs state can change. A parent component can pass props to a child but a component manages state internally.

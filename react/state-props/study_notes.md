## State and Props

- Both props and state are plain JS objects
- Both props and state changes trigger a render update

### Props

In React, *props* (short for properties) are a component's configuration. 

- received from above
- immutable
- considered the "options" of the component

### State

In React, the *state* is a serializable representation of one point in time. 


COMPONENT TYPES

- **Stateless Component** — A stateless component has only props, no state. 
- **Stateful Component** — A statefull component has both props and state.

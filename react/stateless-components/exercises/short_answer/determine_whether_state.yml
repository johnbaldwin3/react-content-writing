  Determine Whether State
question: >-
  Describe how to determine whether a component should have state.
correct_answers: 
  - >-
    If a component retrieves, processes or distributes data it should have state. Stateful components tend to be container components that contain all of the methods for fetching and sorting data. Stateful components also render stateless presentational components, passing data along to the stateless components. State increases complexity and reduces predictability, so making a component stateful should be done sparingly.
